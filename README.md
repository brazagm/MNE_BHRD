# Ecological Niche Modelling for the Rio Doce Riverbasin  
Niche modelling procedures to estimate the geographic distribution of plant species from the Rio Doce Riverbasin, Brazil, and the impacts of climate change in future scenarios. Models were calibrated using ModleR (https://github.com/Model-R/modleR). Modelling procedures includes three steps: (1) Species' occurrence records; (2) Environmental variables; (3) Ecological niche modelling
