# Ecological Niche Modeling plant species from the Rio Doce Riverbasin  
This project aims to forecast the impacts of climate change on the geographic distribution of plant species from the Rio Doce Riverbasin, Brazil, under different future scenarios. Geographic distributions were estimated by Ecological Niche Model calibrated using <i>ModleR</i> (https://github.com/Model-R/modleR). Modeling procedures includes three steps: (1.1) Species' occurrence records; (1.2) Environmental variables; (1.3) Ecological niche modeling. The project also includes post-processing analyses of the models divided into two stages: (2.1) Land-use changes analyses; and (2.2) Dispersal limitations.
